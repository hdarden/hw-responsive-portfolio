# Responsive Portfolio

This project consists of three separate pages creating a responsive portfolio. It consists of "About Me", "Portfolio", and "Contact" pages. The layout of this website consists of a navbar, a main content section and a footer. There are several links to this website including, Bootrap CSS and JS, and links to my css page. 

For this project I utilized Bootstrap in order to create a layout, components, and responsiveness for each of my pages. The components I used are Navbar, Card, Forms, and Footer. Each component was tweaked in order to create the visuals and functionality of the webpage. 

The "About Me" page gives a brief explanation of my background and an image of my headshot. The "Portfolio" page shows 5 snapshots of pictures I have taken from my travels. The "Contact" page is a form for users to fill out in order to contact me.
